# dontet-miniDI

A trivial dependency Injection provider, to write up one that is not integrated into the platform, as a demonstration. 

Not production code, just for fun. It was built in dotnet c#, the misspelling of the repository is a unintentional, but correct naming:

**D**edicated **O**nly **N**aive for **T**raining **E**xperimental **T**utorial - miniDI"
